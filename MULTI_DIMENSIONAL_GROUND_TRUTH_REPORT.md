# Multi-Dimensional Ground Truth for CARLA Scenario Similarity Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report documents the development and validation of a refined multi-dimensional ground truth methodology for CARLA scenario similarity analysis. The updated approach leverages our improved 32-dimensional feature architecture with five complementary similarity dimensions: temporal, motion, behavioral, spatial, and contextual analysis. This methodology addresses critical limitations of filename-based similarity assessment and provides enhanced discrimination between genuinely similar and dissimilar driving scenarios.

**Key Achievement**: Evolved from 4-dimensional to 5-dimensional analysis aligned with refined 32D features, eliminating redundancy while maintaining comprehensive scenario characterization through temporal patterns, motion dynamics, behavioral sequences, spatial geometry, and environmental context.

---

## 1. Background & Motivation

### 1.1 Problem Statement
The original CARLA scenario similarity analysis relied exclusively on filename pattern matching for ground truth generation. This approach had fundamental limitations:

- **Geographic bias**: Only scenarios from the same location (e.g., `ZAM_Tjunction` vs `ZAM_Tjunction`) were considered similar
- **Content blindness**: Identical scenario types in different locations were deemed dissimilar
- **No behavioral analysis**: Actual driving patterns, speeds, and maneuvers were ignored
- **Limited discrimination**: Binary similarity based solely on location names

### 1.2 Research Evolution
The methodology has evolved through multiple iterations:

**Original (4D)**: Behavioral, Spatial, Traffic, Contextual dimensions
**Refined (5D)**: Temporal, Motion, Behavioral, Spatial, Context dimensions

### 1.3 Current Objective (Updated)
Develop a refined, five-dimensional ground truth aligned with 32D feature architecture:
1. **Temporal similarity** - time-based patterns, event frequencies, rates
2. **Motion similarity** - speed profiles, acceleration patterns, dynamics  
3. **Behavioral similarity** - driving patterns, maneuvers, control actions
4. **Spatial similarity** - path geometry, trajectory shapes, navigation complexity
5. **Context similarity** - traffic density, environmental complexity, interactions

## 2. Refined Methodology (32D Architecture)

### 2.1 Multi-Dimensional Framework

displacement_sim = 1 - abs(spatial1[1] - spatial2[1]) / max(spatial1[1], spatial2[1], 1) 
tortuosity_sim = 1 - abs(spatial1[2] - spatial2[2]) / max(spatial1[2], spatial2[2], 1)
spatial_similarity = np.mean([path_length_sim, displacement_sim, tortuosity_sim])
```

#### 2.2.5 Context Features (4D)
- **Traffic Analysis**: Vehicle count and density calculations

### 4.2 Similarity Metric Evaluation Results

**Critical Discovery**: Comprehensive evaluation revealed that similarity metric performance changes dramatically when evaluated against multi-dimensional ground truth vs filename-based ground truth:

| Similarity Metric | vs Filename GT | vs Multi-Dimensional GT | Performance Change |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)** | Not tested | **F1=0.671** ‚≠ê | **WINNER** |

### 4.6 Threshold Sensitivity Analysis (LCS Implementation)

| Threshold | Similarity Rate | Similar Pairs | Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| ‚â•0.50 | 35.5% | ~5,000 | Too permissive |
| ‚â•0.60 | 24.6% | ~3,500 | Reasonable |
| ‚â•0.65 | 23.2% | ~3,300 | Good |
| **‚â•0.70** | **22.4%** | **6,364** | **Optimal (Final)** |
| ‚â•0.75 | ~21% | ~3,000 | Conservative |
| ‚â•0.80 | ~17% | ~2,500 | Very conservative |

**Selected Threshold: 0.70** - Provides optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity with LCS behavioral similarity.

### 4.7 Critical Methodological Discovery

**Ground Truth Dependency of Similarity Metrics**: Our research revealed a fundamental insight about similarity metric evaluation - the choice of ground truth significantly impacts which similarity metric performs best:

#### Phase 3 Original Results (Filename-based GT):
- **Winner**: N-gram Jaccard (F1=0.702, Accuracy=81.2%)
- **Runner-up**: DTW (F1=0.630)
- **Third**: LCS (Not originally tested vs filename GT)

#### Our Multi-Dimensional GT Evaluation:
- **Winner**: LCS (F1=0.671) ‚≠ê **Implemented**
- **Runner-up**: Edit Distance (F1=0.668)  
- **N-gram Jaccard**: Dropped to F1=0.556 (-20.8% performance decline)

**Key Insight**: This demonstrates that:
1. **Ground truth methodology fundamentally affects similarity metric ranking**
2. **N-gram Jaccard was optimized for filename patterns, not behavioral similarity**
3. **LCS better captures behavioral patterns for comprehensive multi-dimensional similarity**
4. **Rigorous re-evaluation is essential when changing ground truth approaches**

This finding validates our decision to comprehensively evaluate all similarity metrics against our new multi-dimensional ground truth rather than assuming previous results would generalize.

## 5. Key Parameters and Design Decisions

### 5.1 Critical Hyperparameters

#### 5.1.1 Dimensional Weights
```python
weights = {
    'behavioral': 0.40,    # Prioritizes actual driving behavior
    'spatial': 0.30,       # Navigation complexity importance
    'traffic': 0.20,       # Interaction complexity
    'contextual': 0.10     # Geographic context (secondary)
}
```

**Rationale**: Behavioral patterns most critical for AV testing scenarios. Spatial complexity second priority for navigation challenges. Traffic and context provide supporting information.

#### 5.1.2 Similarity Threshold
- **Selected Value**: 0.70
- **Rationale**: Balances precision (avoiding false positives) with recall (capturing true similarities)
- **Alternative Considerations**: 0.65 (more inclusive), 0.75 (more conservative)

#### 5.1.3 Sampling Parameters
```python
behavioral_sampling = frame_count // 50    # ~50 behavioral samples
spatial_sampling = frame_count // 30       # ~30 spatial points  
traffic_sampling = frame_count // 20       # ~20 traffic samples
```

**Rationale**: Balances computational efficiency with sufficient data granularity for robust similarity assessment.

### 5.2 Algorithmic Design Choices

#### 5.2.1 Traffic Similarity Scoring
```python
# Tiered percentage-based approach
if percentage_diff <= 0.05:      # Within 5% ‚Üí 0.95 similarity
elif percentage_diff <= 0.10:    # Within 10% ‚Üí 0.85 similarity
elif percentage_diff <= 0.20:    # Within 20% ‚Üí 0.65 similarity
```

**Critical Decision**: Percentage-based rather than absolute differences. Penalizes large vehicle count differences heavily while rewarding close matches.

#### 5.2.2 Spatial Path Similarity
```python
# Distance-based tiered approach
if avg_distance <= 10.0 and max_distance <= 20.0:      # 0.95 similarity
elif avg_distance <= 25.0 and max_distance <= 50.0:    # 0.80 similarity
```

**Critical Decision**: Absolute distance tiers with quadratic length ratio penalties. Ensures only truly similar paths score highly.

#### 5.2.3 Behavioral Action Similarity
```python
# Edit distance normalization
action_sim = 1 - (edit_distance(seq1, seq2) / max(len(seq1), len(seq2)))
```

**Critical Decision**: Edit distance captures action sequence similarity while normalizing for different scenario lengths.

### 5.3 Quality Assurance Parameters

#### 5.3.1 Ego Vehicle Detection
```python
# Multi-method fallback approach
1. log.get_ego_vehicle_id()              # Standard method
2. log.get_actor_ids_with_role_name("ego_vehicle")  # Alternative role
3. log.get_actor_ids_with_type_id("vehicle.*")[0]   # First vehicle fallback
```

#### 5.3.2 Frame Range Validation
```python
frame_count = end_frame - start_frame
if frame_count <= 10:  # Skip very short scenarios
    return None
```

**Rationale**: Ensures sufficient data for reliable similarity assessment.
