## Research Applications

This toolkit is designed for:
- **Autonomous Vehicle Testing**: Optimize test scenarios by identifying redundancies
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Understand driving patterns and vehicle interactions
- **Test Suite Reduction**: Maintain coverage while reducing computational costs
- **Scenario Validation**: Verify that test scenarios cover diverse driving behaviors

## Scenario Reduction Methodology

The tools implement multi-dimensional scenario reduction:

1. **Behavioral Sequences**: Identify scenarios with identical action patterns
2. **Spatial Similarity**: Group scenarios with similar paths and geometries
3. **Traffic Complexity**: Cluster by number and types of vehicles
4. **Temporal Patterns**: Group by duration and timing characteristics
5. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Combine criteria for maximum reduction
